Outlook Macro using VBA to auto forward emails
- email will get forwared to different user
- the email body will be unchanged, the same mail body will forwarded
- filters are set to refine the incoming mails based on sender & subject
- instead of fixing registry used Application_Startup & ItemAdd at Macro session level alone and not using macro script as part of outlook rules
